PROJECT 1
This project replicates and extends analysis by Hanna and Olken.

The project description is to use the data is from the Peruvian Encuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO), maintained by the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica (INEI), Peru. (Available publically) which was analyzed in the reference above. 
Fighting poverty is a major priority for many developing countries and international organi- zations like the United Nations. Strategies for combating poverty often require that governing bodies have accurate information about household level consumption, income, or other measures of welfare. Developing methods for empirical identification of households and regions below a given poverty line is are a major research area in econometrics 
One method in which a government can obtain a signal about measures of welfare is termed a proxy-means test. The implementation of a proxy-means test is usually based on large censuses of the population, in which government enumerators obtain information on easily observable and verifiable assets. The government uses these assets to predict incomes or per-capita consumption or other measures of poverty or welfare by estimating a regression on a smaller sample with detailed measurement of consumption. 
This project is to create a new proxy-means test using a machine learning technique of your choice on a testing sample drawn from the ENAHO. Estimate the MSE on the hold out sample. Compare the hold-out MSE to the hold-out MSE from the Hanna and Olken model. Also replicate the welfare analysis (Figure 5 in the Hanna and Olken reference) with the new proxy-means test with the ENAHO dataset. Describe your findings. 


PROJECT 2
In this project, we aimed to replicate Dubocanin et al. (2019) and further emphasized several ML techniques to perform predictions using the MSE as our accuracy metric. In Section 2, we investigated the raw dataset to understand which features could significantly drive the outcome variable Price. An Exploratory Data Analysis was executed to facilitate further feature engineering and pre-processing (e.g., transforming into logarithmic scale). Section 3 describes the six chosen models – three linear and three non-linear ones – and highlights the main drawbacks and advantages. All of them are tuned to optimize the result on the out-of-sample set, the test set. Section 4 presents the results, and clearly shows that XGboost model achieves the best performance on our dataset. These results can be used to closely monitor the market's health in general, and to better predict market bubbles and likely bursts, so to apply macroeconomic measures to adjust it.
